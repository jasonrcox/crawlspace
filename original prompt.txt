> Create a top-down pixel-style game using the godot game engine.
 This is an idle-sim style gameplay that takes place in the 
crawlspace of a house. The backstory is that millenia ago, a 
small panspermia artificail intelligence probe landed on earth 
and went dormant. Later when the house was being built, a 
squirrel seeking refuge accidentally reactivated the probe which 
 began the process of germinating life suitable for the 
environment its sensors detected. The players job (acting as the 
AI) is to operate the life design terminal inside the device. Be 
creative, design a dark and damp environment with warm earthtones
 and occasional light brightly shining through the vents into the
 crawlspace. Also, wind and rain sometimes leak into the 
crawlspace creating challenges, resources, and sometimes 
destruction. Be creative and suggest game play ideas and progress
 via evolution of the creatures and their technologies. The 
player will hold all device agency for how all these technologies
 look while creating them in the design terminal.
